A basic chat application built using Python, Tkinter, and SQLite. The project consists of a server and a client that allow users to communicate with each other in real-time.

## Features

- User Registration
- User login and logout
- Display active users
- Send and receive messages in real-time chat

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included in Python standard library)

## How to use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install Python 3.x if you haven't already.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

### Running the server

To start the server, run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

python server.py

The server will start listening for incoming connections.

### Running the client

To start a client instance, run the following command in a separate terminal or command prompt:

python client.py

A login window will appear. Enter a username and password or create a new account, and then click "Log In" or "Sign Up" to join the chat. You can run multiple client instances to simulate multiple users.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the chat window by modifying the color codes and fonts in the `client.py` file.
